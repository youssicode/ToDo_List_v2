### Overview

This app offers a streamlined and user-friendly experience for managing multiple task lists. Users can create lists for different categories or projects and easily add tasks to each list. Each list can be managed independently, with options to mark tasks as completed, clear all completed tasks, and delete lists along with their associated tasks. A label in the Tasks section header provides users with a quick view of the number of remaining tasks to be completed.

### Features

**Lists Section**
Add List: Users can create new lists by entering a name in the input field and clicking the + button (or hitting Enter).
List Navigation: All created lists are displayed, allowing users to easily switch between them.

**Tasks Section** - Add Tasks: Once a list is selected, users can add tasks specific to that list. - Mark Tasks as Done: Users can mark individual tasks as completed to keep track of progress. - Clear Completed Tasks: Option to remove all completed tasks from the current list. - Delete List: Allows users to delete an entire list, along with all associated tasks. - Task Counter: A dynamic label in the Tasks section header displays the number of remaining tasks, helping users stay on top of their workload.

**Responsive Design**
The app is fully responsive, providing an optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Data Storage**
All lists, tasks, and their completion statuses are stored locally, allowing users to retain their information for future use and continue managing their tasks seamlessly.
